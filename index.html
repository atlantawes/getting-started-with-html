    <h1>The Basics</h1>
    <p>These initial lessons were <em>literally an introduction</em> to
    <br>the <b>Intro to Programming Nanodegree</b>.  We learned <br>
    some basic concepts, terms, and even a little coding, <br> 
    all helping to  provide a foundation on which we can <br>
    start building our knowledge in future lessons.<br></p>

    <h2>Interacting + Internet</h2>

    <p><b>HTML</b> means <em><b>H</b>ypertext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage.</em><br>
    HTML documents are the heart of the World Wide Web,<br>
    dictating <strong>what you see</strong> and <strong>how you see it</strong>.<br>
    They are made up of both <em>content</em> and <em>commands</em>,<br>
    which combined are referred to as HTML <b>elements</b>.</p>

    <p>What I've called  <em>commands</em> in the above paragraph<br>
    are referred to as <b>tags</b>.  Tags are instructions that <br>
    we, as programmers, use to tell a browser the type<br>
    of element to display on the webpage. They are <br>
    fundamental: without them, we would not be able to<br>
    even see a single line of text.</p>

    <p>There are two types of <b>elements</b>: <em>inline</em> and <em>block</em>.<br>
    A single line of text can contain multiple inline elements,<br>
    such as my above definition of HTML.  Several inline <br>
    elements were employed to display <b>bold</b> text,<br>
    <em>itallics</em>, and <b><em>bold itallics</em></b>.  A block element forms an<br>
    invisible box around the contents inside.</p>

    <h3>An important note (& a hint!)</h3>

    <em>No programmer can remember everything.</em><br>
    But, a quick <a href = "www.google.com">google search</a> for, say,"how to add lines<br>
    in html" will always get your answer!
